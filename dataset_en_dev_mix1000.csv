The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap. With a baby in one hand opening the cap is a night mare.

We have hurt ourselves many time trying to open caps as they have sharp edges on the inner and outer edges. Not worth the price.",Not worth the price and very bad cap design,en,baby_product

68,en_0871983,product_en_0814870,reviewer_en_0045493,1,"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",Simply does not work as described,en,electronics

I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched).

Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says ""foam"" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be.

There's just something about it that makes it so hard to put air into. There was only ONE time out of the 3 that I was actually able to put air into it and it was awesome!!! Other than that, it was not. It was too much work to put air into that I had to make it some kind of a game. I mean, there's just too big of a hole to close off when air is being put into the hammock. I can't say it can hold 440 pounds either. I think it was more like 200 pounds at the most. Any more than that, it will start to flatten. When it was inflated perfectly, many of us were able to hang on the sides and float around. Two of us were able to lay on it without drowning. The mesh actually stayed in one piece too. No rip whatsoever. The fastening of the buckle doesn't make sense to me, but if it works then that is all that matters. I just need to get used to the buckling, I guess. I gave this hammock 4 stars because the idea of a hammock that requires swinging around in a circle to put air into it is cool to me. When it is inflated, it is fun. When it is deflated, it is space saving. And when it is being used, it becomes a fun water activity. Just be careful with it though. The nylon and mesh feels thin, but it can still last a while if taken care of correctly and carefully. Thank you!",Ahhh!,en,toy

I tried to instantly crimp the portion of the blind that was damaged and it didn't change it. It still looked damaged and bent. I was beginning to think 'what a waste of money.' I went away for a few minutes about to call Home Depot to see if they simply had new blinds in stock. Then I stopped myself and thought I'd better give it at least one last try. This time I held the damaged part in the device at a curve and held it for about 30-40 seconds. When I released it it had made it significantly better this time. Then I did kind of the same thing in three little areas on the same damaged part again to try and clean it up a bit more. I would say that made it better by another 20%. I think the key here is you have to hold the damaged part curved in the device for at least 40 seconds, maybe even pushing your thumb along it, and then kind of focus more on the nuanced parts of the same damage portion to try and clean it up after the first attempt. I would say if you are a patient person and are willing to treat the process as a kind of microscopic surgery to an extent as opposed to a job you can complete instantly then I think you'll appreciate this device. If the blinds are still hanging it's basically a situation of pulling up a chair for a good half hour and getting to work like a craftsman on them. Maybe you can speed up the process as you get good at it but just prepare yourself to treat it as if you were about to carve a small wood sculpture. It is rewarding though once you see them sort of come back to life. To add, this really works best on blinds that have been bent simply at a 90 degree angle rather than those that are actually mangled and bumpy. Like I said with the bumps it really takes a bit of work and nuanced focus to get those looking decent again.",Most honest review (I believe),en,other
